## 关于作者

**道格·洛韦（Doug Lowe）** 在发明 Java 的人还在读小学时就开始写计算机编程相关的书籍了。He’s written books on COBOL, FORTRAN, Visual Basic, IBM mainframe computers, mid-range systems, PC’s, web programming, and probably a few he’s completely forgotten about. He’s the author of more than 30 For Dummies books, including Java All-In-One For Dummies, 4th Edition; Java For Dummies Quick Reference; Networking For Dummies, 10th Edition; Networking All-In-One For Dummies, 4th Edition; PowerPoint 2013 For Dummies; and Electronics All-In-One For Dummies. He lives in that sunny Formerly-All-American city Fresno, California, where his motto is, “Buster Posey Got Out, Why Can’t I?”

## Dedication

To my amazing father-in-law Gordon Gearhart, who passed away while I was trying to write this book. Thank you for making this world a better place.

## Author’s Acknowledgments

I want to thank everyone at Wiley who was involved in the creation of this book, starting with project manager Pat O’Brien, who as usual did a great job managing all the editorial work required to put this book together and was very patient when deadlines came and went. I also want to thank acquisitions editor Connie Santisteban for making the whole project possible (happy trails!), as well as Russ Mullen for his excellent and thorough technical review and copy editor Jen Riggs for crossing all my i’s and dotting all my t’s — wait, reverse that!
