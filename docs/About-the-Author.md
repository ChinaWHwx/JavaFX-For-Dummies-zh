## Author’s Acknowledgments

I want to thank everyone at Wiley who was involved in the creation of this book, starting with project manager Pat O’Brien, who as usual did a great job managing all the editorial work required to put this book together and was very patient when deadlines came and went. I also want to thank acquisitions editor Connie Santisteban for making the whole project possible (happy trails!), as well as Russ Mullen for his excellent and thorough technical review and copy editor Jen Riggs for crossing all my i’s and dotting all my t’s — wait, reverse that!
